# Financial_Analysis_Dashboard_PowerBI

This is basically a guided project from YouTube named "Google Sheets Tips and Tricks"
This project helped me further deepen my knowledge in PowerBI and gets to practice my skills on real world project.
It also helped me undedrstand how an analyst view the raw data and further dive to get insights out of it.
In this I used power query, slicers, and other similar PowerBI tools to clean, organize, analyze and later make a dashboard out of it.
In this dashboard I learned how to create Card Visuals with Logo, Pie chart visuals, Bar and Clustered Column chart, Matrix(Table) Visual and Heat Map along with different slicer's and it's formatting.

So overall, I would suggest beginner data analyst(like me) who are starting in PowerBI to learn the basics from any YouTube channel
(I would suggest "Alex the Analyst") and later start practicing with these projects.

So let's connect in Github & LinkedIn & deep-dive furter into data to get the essence of it.
